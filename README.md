# discord-stt-bot

Discord speech to text bot that can join and listen to a voice channel. It listens for specific key words and acts upon them. For example, saying league mutes the user.

To run the bot, you'll need a config.json file, along with a Google Cloud speech API token.

Once you've added it to the server, type !start sentry and !end sentry to start and end listening.
